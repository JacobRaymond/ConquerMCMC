Description: A series of implementations of divide-and-conquer algorithms for Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. These functions provide scalable Metropolis-Hastings samplers to deal with large and disjointed data sets. Three methods, excluding the standard MCMC scheme, are available: the consensus MCMC, the m-posterior, and the scaled subprior. See function descriptions for proper attributions.
