# ConquerMCMC
The final project for the University of Waterloo code STAT840, which I completed during the Winter 2020 semester. Comprised of an R package (ConquerMCMC) implementing three divide-and conquer algorithms for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): the consensus MCMC, the M-Posterior, and the scaled subprior model. See documentation for references.
